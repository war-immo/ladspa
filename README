 cd src; make

this will make the following LADSPA-plugins:

 plugins/kicktrigger.so
           Kick drum trigger that can be used with pre-recorded base drum
           (or whatever you like) tracks for instance in ardour, or in real-time
           mode in order to turn a laptop with jack-rack into a kick drum
           trigger module.
